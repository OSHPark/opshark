# Shark Chassis
This set of boards houses the roving LAN'd Sharks, complete with an ESP8266-12E board for a controller. 


# Software
This code uses the [ESP8266 Arduino](https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino) platform for the codebase. It also uses the Adafruit Neopixel library, which is conveniently included with the ESP Arduino downloads.

# Hardware

A very helpful resource was this tutorial for [creating a shark in maya](http://cgi.tutsplus.com/tutorials/create-a-realistic-shark-in-maya-using-subdivision-surfaces-part-3--cg-31246), even though I only used the 2d outline.
